38256045,Hydrogen Water: Extra Healthy or a Hoax?-A Systematic Review.,"Dhillon G, Buddhavarapu V, Grewal H, Sharma P, Verma RK, Munjal R, Devadoss R, Kashyap R.",Int J Mol Sci. 2024 Jan 12;25(2):973. doi: 10.3390/ijms25020973.,"Hydrogen-rich water (HRW) has emerged as a novel approach in the field of health and wellness. It is believed to have therapeutic antioxidant properties that can neutralize harmful free radicals in the human body. It has also been shown to be beneficial in mitigating oxidative stress-induced damage through its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic pathways. We aim to conduct a systematic review to evaluate the potential benefits of hydrogen-rich water. The review protocol was uploaded on PROSPERO. After the initial search criteria, the articles were reviewed by two blinded investigators, and a total of 25 articles were included in the systematic review. The potential benefits of hydrogen-rich water on various aspects of health, including exercise capacity, physical endurance, liver function, cardiovascular disease, mental health, COVID-19, oxidative stress, and anti-aging research, are a subject of growing interest and ongoing research. Although preliminary results in clinical trials and studies are encouraging, further research with larger sample sizes and rigorous methodologies is needed to substantiate these findings. Current research needs to fully explain the mechanisms behind the potential benefits of hydrogen-rich water. Continued scientific exploration will provide valuable insights into the potential of hydrogen-rich water as an adjunctive therapeutic approach in the future.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//38256045/
36499079,Electrolyzed-Reduced Water: Review I. Molecular Hydrogen Is the Exclusive Agent Responsible for the Therapeutic Effects.,"LeBaron TW, Sharpe R, Ohno K.",Int J Mol Sci. 2022 Nov 25;23(23):14750. doi: 10.3390/ijms232314750.,"Numerous benefits have been attributed to alkaline-electrolyzed-reduced water (ERW). Sometimes these claims are associated with easily debunked concepts. The observed benefits have been conjectured to be due to the intrinsic properties of ERW (e.g., negative oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), alkaline pH, H 2 gas), as well enigmatic characteristics (e.g., altered water structure, microclusters, free electrons, active hydrogen, mineral hydrides). The associated pseudoscientific marketing has contributed to the reluctance of mainstream science to accept ERW as having biological effects. Finally, through many in vitro and in vivo studies, each one of these propositions was examined and refuted one-by-one until it was conclusively demonstrated that H 2 was the exclusive agent responsible for both the negative ORP and the observed therapeutic effects of ERW. This article briefly apprised the history of ERW and comprehensively reviewed the sequential research demonstrating the importance of H 2 . We illustrated that the effects of ERW could be readily explained by the known biological effects of H 2 and by utilizing conventional chemistry without requiring any metaphysical conjecture (e.g., microclustering, free electrons, etc.) or reliance on implausible notions (e.g., alkaline water neutralizes acidic waste). The H 2 concentration of ERW should be measured to ensure it is comparable to those used in clinical studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//36499079/
35385277,Water Oxidation and Hydrogen Evolution with Organic Photooxidants: A Theoretical Perspective.,"Domcke W, Sobolewski AL.",J Phys Chem B. 2022 Apr 21;126(15):2777-2788. doi: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c00705. Epub 2022 Apr 6.,"In this Perspective, we discuss a novel water-splitting scenario, namely the direct oxidation of water molecules by organic photooxidants in hydrogen-bonded chromophore-water complexes. In comparison with the established scenario of semiconductor-based water splitting, the distance of electron transfer processes is thereby reduced from mesoscopic scales to the Ångström scale, and the time scale is reduced from milliseconds to femtoseconds, which suppresses competing loss processes. The concept is illustrated by computational studies for the heptazine-H 2 O complex. The excited-state landscape of this complex has been characterized with ab initio electronic-structure methods and the proton-coupled electron-transfer dynamics has been explored with nonadiabatic dynamics simulations. A unique feature of the heptazine chromophore is the existence of a low-lying and exceptionally long-lived 1 ππ* state in which a substantial part of the photon energy can be stored for hundreds of nanoseconds and is available for the oxidation of water molecules. The calculations reveal that the absorption spectra and the photochemical functionalities of heptazine chromophores can be systematically tailored by chemical substitution. The options of harvesting hydrogen and the problems posed by the high reactivity of OH radicals are discussed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//35385277/
33734561,Hydrogen from Water is more than a Fuel: Hydrogenations and Hydrodeoxygenations for a Biobased Economy.,"Harnisch F, Morejón MC.",Chem Rec. 2021 Sep;21(9):2277-2289. doi: 10.1002/tcr.202100034. Epub 2021 Mar 18.,"Worldwide a hydrogen-based economy is on the political agenda. Its centre forms molecular hydrogen (H 2 ) that should serve mainly as energy carrier and fuel. However, currently and foreseeable in the future H 2 is playing its main role as reactant in the chemical industry. Electrolytic generation and storage of H 2 gas is energy demanding and may hardly become economically at the large scale. We argue that in the overall transition towards an economy that is based on biomolecules and CO 2 as carbon feedstock electrochemical hydrogenations and hydrodeoxygenations in aqueous solutions need to be moved in the centre. Departing from the well-known fact that electrochemistry allows creating reactive hydrogen species from water, i. e. hydrogen in statu nascendi (H . ), at ambient temperature and pressure we illustrate the existing diversity of reactions based thereon. We focus on examples of model compounds from thermal biomass pretreatment and products from real thermal biomass pretreatment (bio-oil). Consequently, we advocate that electrochemical hydrogenations and hydrodeoxygenations have to be further explored and interweaved into existing process lines.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//33734561/
25886650,Noble metal-free hydrogen evolution catalysts for water splitting.,"Zou X, Zhang Y.",Chem Soc Rev. 2015 Aug 7;44(15):5148-80. doi: 10.1039/c4cs00448e. Epub 2015 Apr 17.,"Sustainable hydrogen production is an essential prerequisite of a future hydrogen economy. Water electrolysis driven by renewable resource-derived electricity and direct solar-to-hydrogen conversion based on photochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting are promising pathways for sustainable hydrogen production. All these techniques require, among many things, highly active noble metal-free hydrogen evolution catalysts to make the water splitting process more energy-efficient and economical. In this review, we highlight the recent research efforts toward the synthesis of noble metal-free electrocatalysts, especially at the nanoscale, and their catalytic properties for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We review several important kinds of heterogeneous non-precious metal electrocatalysts, including metal sulfides, metal selenides, metal carbides, metal nitrides, metal phosphides, and heteroatom-doped nanocarbons. In the discussion, emphasis is given to the synthetic methods of these HER electrocatalysts, the strategies of performance improvement, and the structure/composition-catalytic activity relationship. We also summarize some important examples showing that non-Pt HER electrocatalysts could serve as efficient cocatalysts for promoting direct solar-to-hydrogen conversion in both photochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting systems, when combined with suitable semiconductor photocatalysts.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//25886650/
